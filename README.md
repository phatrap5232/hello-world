New beginnings start with enriching the mind
I recently lost a job that should have been the best thing to ever happen to me but alas
that was not to be.  What I discovered is that the company I work for was only about getting the job done not 
the opinions or concerns of its employees.  It was more of a push for me at the end than anything else to find a better way
to earn money without having to work for someone else.  A journey a hope is at an end.
